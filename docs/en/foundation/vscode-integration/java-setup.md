## Quick Setup

The fastest way to get started with Java in VS Code.

### 1. Install the Coding Pack for Java

For a fresh setup on Windows or macOS, the [Coding Pack for Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial#_coding-pack-for-java) is recommended. It includes VS Code, a Java Development Kit (JDK), and the essential Java extensions.

*   [Install for Windows](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win)
*   [Install for macOS](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-mac)

For other operating systems, you'll need to install a JDK, VS Code, and the Java extensions manually.

### 2. Install the Extension Pack for Java

If you already have VS Code installed, you can add Java support by installing the [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack). This pack bundles the core extensions for Java development, including:

*   Language Support for Java™ by Red Hat
*   Debugger for Java
*   Test Runner for Java
*   Maven for Java
*   Project Manager for Java

### 3. Install a JDK

You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8 or newer. If you don't have one, you can download it from sources like [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto), [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk), or [Eclipse Adoptium's Temurin](https://adoptium.net/).

## Development Workflow

Once your environment is set up, you can:

*   **Create Projects**: Use the `Java: Create Java Project` command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P).
*   **Edit Code**: Leverage features like IntelliSense, code snippets, and refactoring.
*   **Run and Debug**: Press F5 to run and debug. You can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and use features like Hot Code Replace.
*   **Test**: Run and debug tests with the Test Runner for Java, which supports JUnit and TestNG.

For more in-depth information on these topics, please consult the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial).

## Enhanced Java Editing in VS Code

Visual Studio Code offers a rich set of features to enhance your Java editing experience. Below is a summary of key functionalities. For a comprehensive guide, refer to the [official documentation on editing Java](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-editing).

### Code Navigation and Search

Efficiently navigate your codebase with these features:

*   **Go to Definition (F12)**: Jump directly to the source code of a symbol.
*   **Peek Definition (⌥F12)**: View a symbol's definition in an inline window without leaving your current context.
*   **Symbol Search**:
    *   **Workspace Search (⌘T)**: Find any symbol within your project.
    *   **File Search (⌘P, then @)**: Locate symbols within the current file.

Here is a demonstration of searching for symbols in your workspace:

### Call and Type Hierarchy

Visualize relationships in your code:

*   **Call Hierarchy**: View all calls to or from a function.
*   **Type Hierarchy**: See the inheritance relationships between Java objects.

Here is a demonstration of the Call Hierarchy feature:

### IntelliSense and Code Completion

Benefit from smart code completions with IntelliSense, powered by the same tools as Eclipse and enhanced with AI through IntelliCode. This feature provides context-aware suggestions based on common practices from thousands of open-source projects.

### Code Snippets

Accelerate your coding with a wide range of built-in and customizable code snippets. For example, typing `sysout` creates `System.out.println()`, and `main` generates the main method structure.

### Refactoring and Source Actions

Improve your code's structure and quality with various refactoring options and quick fixes, such as:

*   Generating getters and setters.
*   Organizing imports.
*   Extracting code to methods or variables.
